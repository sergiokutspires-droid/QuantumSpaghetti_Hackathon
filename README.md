## Why this exists (short)
People have fragmented tools: trackers, coaches, therapists,… None that actually integrate mind, body, behavior and clinical intake into one continuous system. BioHacker OS is the first product engineered to fix that at scale.

This repo contains the core of a web platform that:
- Primes habit formation with game mechanics (XP, levels, streaks)  
- Listens and speaks through voice-to-voice technology (ElevenLabs)
- Performs DSM-5 aligned psychiatric triage and provides supportive guidance through an intelligent voice-to-voice experience.
- Converts goals into 4-week executable roadmaps stored in Airtable obtained from the voice-to-voice chat. 
- Feeds all signals into embedded Power BI analytics.

If you want boost human performance and to make it measurable and unstoppable — this is the foundation.

## What makes this indispensable
1. Gamification first: Habit formation is redesigned as an immersive reward loop that makes improvement inevitable;
2. Clinical-grade intake: Talk openly while the system gently gathers DSM-5–based symptom insights. If you show signs of strong negative beliefs or risk patterns, it can guide you towards connecting with a qualified expert;
3. Voice native: Speak. Be heard. Be coached. Everything begins in a human-like conversation;
4. Actionable roadmaps: Your goals are used to generate a personalised 4 weeks’ plan of step-by-step execution;
5. Unified analytics: Behavioral + biological data visualization for real, well-founded decisions.

This is not another app. It is a new operating system for the human organism.

## Core features (brief)
- Voice-to-Voice AI: natural speech input → LLM reasoning → ElevenLabs TTS output;
- Psychiatry Module: Talk mode (empathy) + Triage mode (DSM-5 checklists → clinician summary);
- Goal Engine: AI generates week 1–4 plans; sync to Airtable; animated UI reveal;
- Gamification: XP, streaks, badges and progress levelling, which boosts motivation and drives adherence;
- Tracker + Dashboards: sleep, mood, stress, steps, hydration, nutrition, study/deep work, etc. → Power BI embeds which change as more data is retrieved;
- Secure architecture: all API keys are stored server-side; n8n orchestrates workflows and logging; Azure provides data storage.

## Tech snapshot
- Frontend: bolt.new (fast web UI);
- Orchestration: n8n (AI & automation workflows);
- Reasoning: OpenAI (LLM logic & triage);
- Voice: ElevenLabs (humanized TTS);
- Storage: Airtable (goal + roadmap data) and Azure (data);
- Analytics: Power BI (embedded dashboards).

## Safety & ethics (non-negotiable)
- The psychiatric module does not diagnose. It collects structured symptom data and outputs summaries for clinicians.  
- Users are reminded this is a pre-assessment tool and not a substitute for professional care.  
- All personal health data must be handled with encryption and explicit user consent.
